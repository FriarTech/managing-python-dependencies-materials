00:02 Congratulations on completing the setting up reproducible environments 
00:05 and application deploys module in the course. 
00:09 Here is what you learned. 
00:11 You started out by learning what requirements files are, 
00:13 what they are good for and how they can help you out 
00:16 in your Python development workflow. 
00:18 Next, you learned how to capture project dependencies 
00:20 using the pip freeze command; right after that, 
00:23 you learned how to restore captured dependencies using the pip install command. 
00:27 In the fourth lecture, you learned how to separate 
00:30 your development and production dependencies, 
00:32 so that your production deploys can run lean and mean. 
00:35 And last, you learned some best practices around requirements files 
00:38 that make working with them a little bit easier. 
00:41 Here is a quick recap of this module in the course. 
00:44 Requirements files allow you to specify 
00:47 all of the third party dependencies of a Python program. 
00:50 This is really powerful, it allows you to make your dependency installs 
00:54 and application deployments fully repeatable. 
00:57 The pip package manager includes everything you need 
01:00 to capture an restore third party dependencies.
